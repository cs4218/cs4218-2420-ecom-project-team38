# CS4218 E-Commerce Web App

### Setting Up

1. In the root directory, run `npm install` to install the backend dependencies.

2. Navigate into the frontend directory by running `cd client` followed by `npm install` to install the frontend dependencies.

3. For the database, you may use our MongoDB cluster. To use your own cluster instead, simply replace the `MONGO_URL` variable in the root directory's `.env` file with your MongoDB connection string.

### Running the Application

1. In the root directory, run `npm run dev` to run the application locally.

2. On your browser, visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

- To run frontend tests only, run `npm run test:frontend`
